2. Check if the account subdomain is valid
  
        account.valid_site?   
        
3. Get more info about the user's account
    
        response = account.user_info
        
        response #=> {"rsp"=>{"user"=>{"author"=>"Jordan Dobson","admin"=>"true","email"=>"jordandobson@gmail.com"},"stat"=>"ok"}}

        response = account.post("My Title", "My Body")
        
    * You can also choose to set the post as private and/or use the optional Author Name
    * In this example we set false for not private and true to use the author name
    
        response = account.post("My Title", "My Body", false, true) 
        

5. Get a success or error hash back

    * If you want all of them don't include any limiting or range. Defaults to up to 999 posts on one page

    * If you want to limit the results include a limit (1-999) and which page (used for paging)
